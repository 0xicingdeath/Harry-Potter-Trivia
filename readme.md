#Harry Potter Trivia 

This was a project I made in high school to understand and interact with Java's Swing GUI library. It contains a Jeopardy-like board, where you gain points by answering questions.  

##Things I learned 

 1. How to set up GUI's properly (ie: playing around with BorderLayouts) and other swing items 

##Things I Would Change 

 + I would choose a much better data structure - as my current one is extremely taxing, and may run very slowly on other computers. 
 + I would consider an array of objects (at the time, I did not understand this concept) instead, containing whether the question has been answered and the numbers of points required rather than having them as constant variables.
